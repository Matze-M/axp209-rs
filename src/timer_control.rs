//! The AXP209 contains a countdown timer. You won't see the time stored in
//! the register change over time, but once the specified amount of time has
//! passed (give or take) the `expired` field will be set to true.
//! 
//! Writing to the register with the `expired` bit set will (re)start the 
//! countdown. No testing has been done to see how accurate the time is, but
//! it's likely just an estimate.
//! 
//! For this library, to save communication overhead, changes to this struct
//! are not passed to the chip automatically and so commiting the changes is
//! required. Here's an example of how to set the timer for five minute and
//! busywait for it to expire:
//! 
//! ```
//!     // Use the timer on the NTC C.H.I.P. on Linux
//!     let i2c = I2cdev::new("/dev/i2c-0").unwrap();
//!     let mut pmic = Axp209::new(i2c);
//!     let timer = pmic.timer_control();
//!     
//!     timer.set_minutes(5);
//!     timer.set_expired(true);
//!     pmic.set_timer_control(timer);
//! 
//!     while {
//!         // You should do something meaninful here. ðŸ˜ƒ
//! 
//!         // The expiry will have reset when we set the timer
//!         let timer = pmic.timer_control();
//!         if timer.expired() {
//!             // The timer's done! Hazaa!
//!             break;
//!         }
//!     }
//! ```
//! 
//! The AXP209 has the ability to send an interrupt when the timer expires
//! but that hasn't been implemented here yet.
